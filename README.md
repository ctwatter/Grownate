# Grownate
 
Grow-nate is an augmented reality game where you can plant trees and maintain a virtual garden! 
Using geotagging technology, players are able to maintain their own collection of trees as well 
as visit and view trees that other people have grown at any time they want.

With the world’s climate and environment at risk, we wanted our game to have a positive impact 
on the world. That’s why we have decided to allow users to watch advertisements or donate to 
charity in order to obtain more seeds to plant trees, from which all proceeds 
will be donated to charities.
